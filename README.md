# Sudoku-Game

This is a Sudoku board game that comes with a built-in assistance feature.

Run the GameBoard class to start the game. After starting, you will see an empty sudoku game board. You can click "file"
and then click "open" to open a sudoku puzzle from the resources file. For example: you can open "puzzle1.txt" to start
a new game with a pre-made sudoku puzzle. After opening this file, the game will start a timer to keep track of how long
you have been working on the puzzle. There is also a save feature under "file" where you can save your progress and your
time spent. The game will inform you when you have successfully comepleted a given puzzle with a celebratory message, and
every cell on the board will turn green.

Assistant: 
While playing the game, you can hover your mouse over a cell on the Sudoku board, and a handy tooltip will tell you which
numbers can be legally placed in that cell following the standard Sudoku game rules.
